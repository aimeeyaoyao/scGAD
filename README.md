# scGAD: a new task and end-to-end framework for generalized cell type annotation and discovery.
# Introduction
Here, we propose a new, realistic, and challenging task called generalized cell type annotation and discovery in the single-cell annotation field. To effectively tackle this task, we propose a novel end-to-end algorithmic framework called scGAD. Moreover, we design the comprehensive comparison baselines and evaluation benchmarks to validate the practicality of scGAD, and the experimental results on simulation and real datasets demonstrate that scGAD outperforms other state-of-the-art annotation and
clustering methods under the three kinds of accuracy.
